# How to upload images

1. Click on `Upload files`
2. `Choose your files` to select the image to upload. Make sure that images are not too big and in **jpeg/jpg** or **png** format. A width of 600 to maximally 1200 pixels is typically plenty large (i.e. less than **~2Mb**). You can scale your image to these dimensions using any photo editing software. For example, a convenient free online tool for scaling images is available [here](https://www168.lunapic.com/editor/?action=scale).
3. Include your image in other files using the synax `![](images/IMAGENAME.jpg "Image Mouseover Title")` with the correct image file name (and file extension) and title (for mouseover). Note that if your images are in a folder different from `images`, you need to adjust this part of the filepath accordingly as well.
