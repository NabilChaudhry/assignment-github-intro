# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory assignment: Intro to GitHub and R (part 1). For a step-by-step guide on how to complete an assignment and submit it for grading, please watch the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/bRkpm1LTpkY).

## Setup

If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray!

## Assignment

Fill out the questions in the [`assignment.md`](assignment.md) (the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/bRkpm1LTpkY) will be a useful starting point but note that the assignment questions are slightly different than those covered in the tutorial).

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, submit by creating a pull request with `submit` as the **base branch** and your instructor as the reviewer (follow the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/bRkpm1LTpkY) to learn how to do this).

## Grading

This assignment will be graded based solely on completeness for Questions 1-4 (i.e. if you fill out all questions and submit it in time you get full marks) and based on the correct answers for each chapter in Question 5.
